# TODO List for Updating References to Harvard Style

- [x] Update the header sentence in CHANGELOG.md to use inline Harvard citations (e.g., "The format is based on Keep a Changelog (2023), and this project adheres to Semantic Versioning (2023).")
- [x] Add a References section at the end of CHANGELOG.md with full Harvard-style citations for "Keep a Changelog" and "Semantic Versioning", including URLs and access dates.
